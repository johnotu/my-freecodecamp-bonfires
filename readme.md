Hi!

I've been going through the Fullstack JavaScript Web Development classes at [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com) and the experience has been awakening.

Just realised I can get help with making the codes I've written for the Bonfires better in quality if people looked at them.

So, if you know a better way to get the same thing done, you are free to laugh but don't fail to send me a pull request. Thanks in advance!
